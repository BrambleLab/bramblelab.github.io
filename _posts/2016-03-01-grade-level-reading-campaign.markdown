In the fall of 2014, Social Design Associate Becky Slogeris convened a cohort of 7 MICA graduate students to work on a branding, products and services for the Baltimore Campaign for Grade Level Reading. A year later, Bramble Lab was approached to continue that work with a series of daily reading tools and, in 2016, the B'more Read More campaign officially commenced.

The following work was borne out of the partnership of campaign leaders Kimberly Manns and Carrie Finkelstein with that practice-based studio, conducting user research, design thinking workshops and collaborative ideation with the families at Cherry Hill Homes, students and parents at Mount Royal Elementary, B'More for Healthy Babies, The Family League and many others.

Thank you to the coalition members, families and, particuarly, the rest of MICA cohort – Becky Slogeris (MASD '12), Jen Sullivan (MASD '15), Emily Ianaconne (MASD '15), Maysan Madani (MASD '15), Meltem Sahin, and Li Zhang – upon whose insights and work this was based.

### Daily Reading Tools - Brochure

This brochure was created to clarify the cumulative benefits of daily reading for time-crunched, stressed or low-literacy parents. Co-created with Jen Sullivan (MASD '15), Cary Euwer came up with the concept during his stint in the practice-based studio at MICA.

The brochure includes a refrigerator magnet with tips and resources to assist in daily reading, referring parents to the campaign's website for more in-depth reading tips.

### Reading Label Post-Its

The reading label post-it notes were conceived by Jessica, a parent at Cherry Hill homes. During a design thinking workshops, she shared how she'd labeled objects all over her home as a reminder to both her children and herself to engage in daily reading.

Of all the daily reading materials, it has received the most positive feedback by far from parents across the city. Each features sample discussion questions by reading experts. Below are the first rendition and a more fleshed-out rendition of these Reading Labels.

### Sticker Tips for Books

Building a daily reading habit with your children can seem like a daunting task. These stickers, distributed with books through Enoch Pratt libraries, Little Free Libraries, Judy Centers, Head Start and other service providers help by giving basic tips.

### B'more Read More Website

Aside from the Daily Reading Tools, the other task was to create a website that informed and addressed parents' key concerns around reading. And those were:

* How can I help them succeed?
* How do I know where my child is?
* How can I help myself?

For a parent, part of getting those questions answered online is having a clear path to that information. That meant that first, the whole website had to be optimized for mobile viewing, which most visitors would be using. And second, the website needed simple, clear path to the information they need.

One of the ideas was to distill the benefits, tips and milestones of daily reading into one page that is illustrative and clear for overwhelmed parents. And that all oriented around the timeline concept used in the brochure and poster.

Foremost on the Parents page is a primer on the rewards of daily reading, illustrating how a small activity can amplify into a lifetime of benefits. Below that is the first question that parents have - What can I do? Parents can answer by selecting an age group, including adulthood if their own literacy is a concern. Under each age group, all appropriate tips and guidance are summed up. This includes milestones to address the other big concern that the campaign found: "How do I know where my child is?". Each has a printable PDF version for use by both parents and service providers.

At the bottom, parents can navigate local resources on a map and view tips by parents interviewed over the course of the project by GLR.

### SMS Service & Timer App (Concept)

Based on insights from parents during an East Baltimore focus group, Bramble Lab created this web app and texting service. Prompted on the B'more Read More website, this feature would allow parents to specify ideal times of the day to read to their child, at which time a daily reading tip with a link to a timer web-app would be sent via text.
