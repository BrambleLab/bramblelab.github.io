1 in 3 women and girls lack access to WASH (clean water, sanitation and hygiene). This has far-reaching impacts on their health, safety (including gender-based violence), reproductive rights and access to educational and vocation opportunity. On a creative team driven by We Divine Water and including Provoc, WaterAid's 2017 #GirlStrong campaign sought to inform and spark civic engagement around WASH access for women and girls around the world.

### Team

Many thanks to everyone involved in the project, including Cecili Thompson Williams, Erica Priggen Wright, Jo√©lle Azoulay, as well as WaterAid's researchers, associates and the many women and girls around the world upon whose testimonies this work was based.

### Call to Action

The acronym WASH covers three overlapping but nevertheless distinct topics: clean water, sanitation and hygiene. In order to lend WaterAid some flexibility during their campaign to go after each issue, the creative team conceived of a flexible call to action. Multiple versions of all deliverables were created for these CTA's, which were: "Clean Water is a Human Right", "Safe Toilets are a Human Right", and "Hygiene is a Human Right".

I developed a sub-brand to accompany these CTA's and create a link between water access and women's rights. In addition, I developed a visual theme based on WaterAid's blue and yellow color scheme that was used across all campaign assets.

### Banner Ads

This can be seen in the campaign's digital strategy, which used banner ads to encourage engagement. The ads highlighted the central statistic used in the PSA video and infographic: 1 in 3 women and girls lack access to WASH. These ads were pushed across social media, blogs and websites targeting strategic sectors of the public, the media and policy-makers.

### Infographics

The infographics were based on intensive study of WaterAid's research and testimonials of dozens's of women and girls suffering WASH inaccessibility. The style sought to reflect the light, comedic tone of the accompanying PSA video, while using statistics to convey the breadth and severity of the problem, and quotes to express the individual experience of women and girls across the world.

The infographic was created for multiple contexts: for print materials, online viewing in full and in bite-size snippets for social media.

### Design Assets

In conjunction, I developed flexible a design template including fact sheets, pamphlets, event flyers and social media templates.
