In early 2016, we read about advocacy work done by Baltimoreans for Educational Equity to bring transparency to the salaries of Full-Time Equivalent employees in the City Schools Budget.

__Baltimoreans for Educational Equity__

Their next goal was to put pressure on mayoral candidates to remain accountable to educational equity, and in February we began working together on ways to reach out to voters - particularly parents and teachers - to motivate action around the Mayor's influence on Baltimore's children. Using insights from discussions with voters, BEE had compiled a list of yes/no questions - demands - for the candidates, and we worked with Chanda, Taylor and Liz on a guide to the mayoral race that would inform voters on both the system of mayoral influence on schools, as well as each candidates' responses to voter demands.

On March 24th, BEE held a mayoral forum on education with the below voter guides distributed to the audience and candidates, and available online.

This first version of the voter guide was made for the 2016 Mayoral Forum on Education at Clyburn Arboretum.

BEE based their questions on a series of discussion sessions with voters, which they distilled into 6 Yes/No questions for candidates.

The majority of the forum was focused around audience questions. Helping voters feel informed enough  about the convoluted relationship between Baltimore's children and the mayor was important to inducing a demand for accountability of the mayor.
