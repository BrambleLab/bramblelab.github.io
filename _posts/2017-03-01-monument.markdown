Speaking out against gender-based violence against immigrant women, the 2017 Monument Quilt West Coast Tour would culminate in a civic action on the US-Mexico border on Trump's 100th day in office. These social media-based flyers and infographics were created to encourage participation and action.

"The Monument Quilt is a crowd-sourced collection of thousands of stories from survivors of rape and abuse. By stitching our stories together, we are creating and demanding public space to heal."

### Team

The team was made up of Monument Quilt co-founders Hannah Brancato and Rebecca Nagle, as well as activist and Executive Director of La Casa Mandarina, Mora Fernández. Lead designer was Cary Euwer. Thank you for including Bramble in this awe-inspiring project. 

### Promotional Visuals

The mission of the monument quilt – stitching together disparate stories into a cohesive story to effect change – gave a perfect visual metaphor. The metaphor had a evocative counterpoint in the brutally exclusionary actions of the Trump administration at the time: legal and civic action against the Trump administration's increased deportations of illegal immigrants, his "border wall" and the "Muslim Ban" were dominating the news cycle.

We decided to visually evoke this tension between inclusion and exclusion with imagery of barricades and stitches. All images were formatted for sharing on Facebook and Twitter.

### Infographics

The same imagery was used to create infographics about the female immigrant experience. This particular group is particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, both in the process of immigrating and after they'd settled in the U.S., where they're frequently targeted because of their fear of being deported.

At the time, the public was still reeling from the Trump administrations' broader actions. In addition to enlightening and promoting civic engagement for the tour, it felt all the more important to illustrate the experience of sub-groups who would be affected by the administrations' actions.
