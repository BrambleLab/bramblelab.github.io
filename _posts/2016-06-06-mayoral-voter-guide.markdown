You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

			<h3>Voter Guides to the 2016 Mayoral Race</h3>
			<p>In early 2016, we read about advocacy work done by Baltimoreans for Educational Equity to bring transparency to the salaries of Full-Time Equivalent employees in the City Schools Budget.</p>
			<p>Their next goal was to put pressure on mayoral candidates to remain accountable to educational equity, and in February we began working together on ways to reach out to voters - particularly parents and teachers - to motivate action around the Mayor's influence on Baltimore's children. Using insights from discussions with voters, BEE had compiled a list of yes/no questions - demands - for the candidates, and we worked with Chanda, Taylor and Liz on a guide to the mayoral race that would inform voters on both the system of mayoral influence on schools, as well as each candidates' responses to voter demands.</p>
			<p>On March 24th, BEE held a mayoral forum on education with the below voter guides distributed to the audience and candidates, and available online.</p>

			<p>This first version of the voter guide was made for the 2016 Mayoral Forum on Education at Clyburn Arboretum.</p>
			<p>BEE based their questions on a series of discussion sessions with voters, which they distilled into 6 Yes/No questions for candidates.</p>

			<p>The majority of the forum was focused around audience questions. Helping voters feel informed enough  about the convoluted relationship between Baltimore's children and the mayor was important to inducing a demand for accountability of the mayor.</p>
