			<h2>School Readiness Campaign</h2>
      <p>Fund for Educational Excellence</p>
			<p>In the fall of 2014, Social Design Associate Becky Slogeris convened a cohort of 7 MICA graduate students to work on a branding, products and services for the Baltimore Campaign for Grade Level Reading. A year and a half later, the B'more Read More campaign was officially commenced.</p>
			<p>The following work was borne out of the partnership of campaign leaders Kimberly Manns and Carrie Finkelstein with that practice-based studio, conducting user research, design thinking workshops and collaborative ideation with the families at Cherry Hill Homes, students and parents at Mount Royal Elementary, B'More for Healthy Babies, The Family League and many others.</p>
			<p>Thank you to the rest of the cohort - Emily Ianaconne (MASD '15), Maysan Madani (MASD '15), Meltem Sahin, Becky Slogeris (MASD '12), Jen Sullivan (MASD '15) and Li Zhang - upon whose work this was based.</p>
			<h3>Daily Reading tools - Borchure</h3>
			<p>Co-created with Jen Sullivan (MASD '15), Cary Euwer came up with the concept of this daily reading brochure during his stint in the practice-based studio at MICA. Intended to clarify the cumulative benefits of daily reading for time-crunched, stressed and sometimes low-literacy parents, Bramble Lab was approached by the campaign to expand a series of daily reading tools based on this brochure concept.</p>

			<p>The brochure includes a refrigerator magnet, condensed tips and a link to the campaign's website for more in-depth parent tips.</p>
			<img src="../img/glr_brochure_2.jpeg">
			<p>Back: the timeline concept was used on throughout the daily reading tools and the parent webpage to illustrate the cumulative benefits of daily reading.</p>
			<h3>Reading Label Post-Its, Book Label</h3>
			<p>Given positive feedback, the first rendition of the Reading Labels (above) will be further developed into the below renditions.</p>

			<h3>Daily Reading Poster</h3>
			<p>Created in part with service providers and parent focus groups to be displayed in service provider offices across the city (eg Head Start, Judy Centers) both as a stand-alone object and a tool for service providers to communicate the benefits of daily reading to parents.</p>

			<h3>B'more Read More Website</h3>
			<p>Aside from the Daily Reading Tools, the other task was to create a website that informed and addressed parents' key concerns around reading. And those were:
</p>
			<p>How can I help them succeed?
			How do I know where my child is?
			How can I help myself?
			For a parent, part of getting those questions answered online is having a clear path to that information. That meant that first, the whole website had to be optimized for mobile viewing, which most visitors would be using. And second, the website needed simple, clear path to the information they need.
</p>
			<img src="../img/glr_website_1.png">
			<p>One of the ideas was to distill the benefits, tips and milestones of daily reading into one page that is illustrative and clear for overwhelmed parents. And that all oriented around the timeline concept used in the brochure and poster.</p>
			<p>Foremost on the Parents page is a primer on the rewards of daily reading, illustrating how a small activity can amplify into a lifetime of benefits. Below that is the first question that parents have - What can I do? Parents can answer by selecting an age group, including adulthood if their own literacy is a concern. Under each age group, all appropriate tips and guidance are summed up. This includes milestones to address the other big concern that the campaign found: "How do I know where my child is?". Each has a printable PDF version for use by both parents and service providers.</p>
			<p>At the bottom, parents can navigate local resources on a map and view tips by parents interviewed over the course of the project by GLR.</p>
