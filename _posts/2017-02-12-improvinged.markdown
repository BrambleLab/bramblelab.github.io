Ongoing work for Improving Education, a Baltimore-based nonprofit that helps schools, parents, teachers and education leaders learn to improve using a user-centered, improvement-science-based process.

### Team

The team consisted of Improving Education's CEO Jarrod Bolte, with Cary Euwer serving as design lead and assisting with content. Bramble is honored to have been a part of Jarrod's innovative approach to applying improvement science to teacher innovation.

### Early-Grade Literacy Toolkit

The Toolkit included techniques for teaching early-grade literacy using student grouping processes, tested using improvement science methods. It's since been made available to teachers across Baltimore City in partnership with Baltimore City Public Schools.

Created as printable pdf's for time-crunched BCPSS teachers, the toolkits provide an overview of the improvement science methods used to test the student grouping techniques, instructions and worksheets. It was all designed to be easily navigable in the classroom context; for that reason, we designed visual cues to easily distinguish between instructions and worksheets.

Bedtime in a Box is a product that provides all the materials needed for a healthy bedtime routine, with the intention of building a daily reading habit. The box includes bedtime reading, pajamas, an alarm clock, and this bedtime routine checklist.
