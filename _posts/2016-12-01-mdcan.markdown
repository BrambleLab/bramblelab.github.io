Presented to Mayor Pugh in tandem with legislating enabling city-wide enrollment in their choice of after-school program, the app allows students to first create a profile, inputting their name, an avatar, their school, grade and gender.

After picking their interests, students are shown a map showing nearby extracurriculars available in a feasible time-frame via public transportation. Each program is color-coded by interest category to allow for easier navigation, and shows the affiliated school, times, description, enrollment criteria, transport options, contact info and a quick-enroll button.

The student's profile page provides an overview of their after-school curriculum, waitlisted programs, as well as nearby featured programs.
