  Based out of the Baltimore Impact Hub, Bramble Lab is a social design initiative and design firm. Our passion lies in the belief that education is a fundamental human right, and that design is a powerful tool in securing that right. To that end, we work with organizations from across the city at the intersection of education, public health and policy.
